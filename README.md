# Dirty-Folder
Get your creepiest directory cleaned

<ul>
<li>The creepiest directory which i have is <strong>Downloads</strong> folder. </li>
<li>Whatever we save goes to our downloads directory.</li>
<li>So Basically this folder contains many audio,video,pictures,torrent files and so on. If they are moved to their respective directory 
where they are supposed to be,this folder becomes less creepy and easier to search when we have to find a particular file. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Currently it supports four formats video,audio,image and torrents.You can add as many formats as you want.Make sure
  that you add the location where you have to save for the formats </li>
  <li>Now this script actually moves the file when the file format matches with the formats which u gave. You can modify it to
  copy or move</ul>
